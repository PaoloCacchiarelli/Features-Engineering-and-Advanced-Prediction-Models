# Feature engineering, advanced models and results interpretation.

**Purpose and scope:**

The primary objective is to support appraisers in the complex process of valuing properties (Real estate market). Machine learning models have been developed to predict property sale prices based on certain characteristics.

The goal is to improve performance and gain a deeper understanding of the problem. To this end, data transformations were applied and several advanced models were trained.

What can you learn about the problem you're addressing by studying your own model? Let's find out!
